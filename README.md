# Overview

quantumzero aims to automate the design of annealing schedules in a hybrid quantum-classical framework. We study both MCTS and QZero algorithms's performance in discovering effective annealing schedules even when the annealing time is short for the 3-SAT examples.

# Software requirements

## OS Requirements
This package is supported for macOS and Windows. The package has been tested on the following systems:

macOS: Mojave (10.14.1)

windows 10

## Python Dependencies
quantumzero mainly depends on the Python scientific stack.

numpy

math

scipy

matplotlib

qutip


# Demo
One can download the code pacage,and directly run "demo-mcts", "demo-sd","demo-QZERO" to get the results for some examples.
